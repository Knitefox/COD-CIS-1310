    <h1>The Internal Combustion Engine</h1>
    <p>The internal combustion engine is a common machine that burns a fuel to convert chemical energy into mechanical energy.</p>
    <p>Most people are familiar with the 'otto cycle four-stroke' piston engine. Most cars today use this design as well as generators.</p>
    <p>This type of engine has four 'phases' to an engine cycle: intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust. </p>
    <p>The easiest way to remember these steps is with the phrase: suck, squeeze, bang, and blow! </p>
    <p>There are many other types of engines, but the four stroke piston engine is by far the most common.</p>
