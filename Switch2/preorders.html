          <p>To secure your preorder for the Nintendo Switch 2, here's a breakdown of the typical process and current availability:</p>

          <h3>Official Nintendo Channels:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>My Nintendo Store (via Invitation):</strong> Nintendo implemented an invitation system for pre-orders through their official My Nintendo Store. Invitations were primarily sent out to Nintendo Account holders who had an active 12-month Nintendo Switch Online membership and at least 50 hours of gameplay logged before April 2, 2025.</li>
            <li><strong>Nintendo Store Physical Locations:</strong> While the Nintendo Stores in New York and San Francisco do not typically take in-store pre-orders, check their websites for launch day availability.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Major Retailers (Online and In-Store):</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walmart:</strong> Pre-orders were available online, with some promising launch day delivery for early orders placed before 8:00 AM ET on June 4th. Check for restocks.</li>
            <li><strong>Target:</strong> Online pre-orders were available but are currently sold out. Monitor their website for availability.</li>
            <li><strong>Best Buy:</strong> Announced midnight launch events for pre-order pickups.</li>
            <li><strong>GameStop:</strong> Online and in-store pre-orders available. Additional units expected June 4th, with sales starting at 3 PM local time.</li>
            <li><strong>Amazon:</strong> Invite-only pre-order system. Check your inbox for eligibility.</li>
            <li><strong>UK Retailers:</strong> Very, Currys, ShopTo, and others had pre-order bundles, though availability fluctuates.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Tips for Securing a Preorder (Ongoing):</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Check retailer websites frequently.</li>
            <li>Sign up for restock alerts or app notifications.</li>
            <li>Follow trusted gaming news sources and retailers on social media for real-time updates.</li>
            <li>Act quickly—stock tends to sell out within minutes.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Important Considerations:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Retailers may offer bundles that include games or accessories. These may have better availability.</li>
            <li>Some stores will offer limited quantities on launch day (June 5, 2025). Contact stores to confirm their procedures.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Given the high demand, persistence and timing are key to securing a Nintendo Switch 2 preorder.</p>
