          <p>Despite strong initial interest, the Nintendo Switch 2 has not been without controversy. Critics have pointed to the use of an LCD screen rather than OLED, the $450 base price, and the $80 price tag for first-party titles as major points of concern. Additionally, the lack of a trophy or achievement system has disappointed some fans.</p>
          <p>Limited availability of pre-orders and an invite-only reservation system through the My Nintendo Store have also led to frustration, particularly in the U.S. market. Resellers have taken advantage of the situation, with early listings already appearing at inflated prices.</p>
          <p>Industry analysts are divided on whether the price point will hurt long-term sales, especially given global inflation and competition from other consoles. Still, Nintendo's loyal fan base and exclusive game library may offset early criticism as the console matures.</p>
