          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is scheduled to launch on June 5, 2025, with a suggested retail price of $449.99 for the console alone. A bundle including a digital copy of Mario Kart World will be available for a limited time through Fall 2025 at $499.99.</p>
          <p>The initial lineup of launch titles includes Mario Kart World, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, Hogwarts Legacy, and Cyberpunk 2077. Additionally, upgrade packs for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the new console will be available for $9.99 for those who already own the original Switch versions.</p>
          <p>Pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been underway, primarily through the My Nintendo Store via an invitation system for those who registered interest and met specific criteria, such as being active Nintendo Switch Online members with a significant playtime history. Retailers like Very, Currys, ShopTo, and Amazon in the UK have also had pre-order bundles available, though stock has been fluctuating. In the US, while initial waves of invites have gone out through the My Nintendo Store, stock at major retailers like Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, and Target has been sporadic. GameStop has announced that additional units will be available in-store and online at launch on June 4th, with sales starting at 3 PM local time and pickups at midnight.</p>
          <p>Nintendo itself has a somewhat conservative sales forecast for the Switch 2, aiming for 15 million units sold during its launch window. This target is similar to the original Nintendo Switch's sales in its initial ten months. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa has indicated that the higher price point of the Switch 2 compared to its predecessor is a key factor in this projection. While pre-order demand has been high, suggesting strong initial interest, the $450 price tag might make it a less impulsive purchase than the original $300 Switch. However, the backward compatibility with Nintendo Switch games and software bundles are strategies Nintendo is employing to encourage early adoption.</p>
